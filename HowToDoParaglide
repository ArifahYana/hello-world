How to do paragliding
First you need to parachute onto the hill where you will make your jump. It should be noted that the weight of the parachute can vary between 6-15 kg. When you're climbing a hill, all you need is a paragliding wing. As a paragliding pilot, they should be careful to make sure that the pitch is not obstructed by anything like trees or structures. Paragliding pilots should run downhill, and not run too fast because the wind helps enough. The type of sports parachute used in paragliding is designed for easier take-off and landing.
