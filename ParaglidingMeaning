Paragliding is one of the extreme sports found in the early 1980s by people interested in aerial sports, 
and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes. 
Paragliding is generally more accessible than any extreme sports since it does not require a special 
take off or a landing track. Paragliding is also the fastest developed air sport in the world.
