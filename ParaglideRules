-The first thing to watch out for when paragliding is the wind. If you do paragliding without paying attention to the wind, your parachute may shut down or you may have difficulty to control yourself.

-Helmets must be worn on all flights. In addition, visibility during flight should not be less than 1800m.

-The selected flight areas should be suitable for flight. There should be no obstacles like trees or shrubs. 

-Take off and landing areas, wind cover and others should be taken into consideration. In addition, first aid kit must be available in the flight area.

-Anyone under 100 kilograms can do paragliding except for pregnant women, asthma patients, heart disease and epilepsy patients.
